UBMP4.1 is a development board for learning or teaching PICmicro programming. UBMP4.1 is programmed through its USB Type-C port using the USB ÂµC Bootloader, which makes UBMP4.1 appear as a USB mass storage device, or by connecting a PICkit-4 or compatible programmer to the in-circuit serial programming (ICSP) connector.
