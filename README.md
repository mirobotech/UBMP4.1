UBMP4.1 is a development board for learning or teaching PICmicro programming in C using almost any device â€“ including Chromebooks!

## UBMP4.1 Hardware Features

- Microchip PIC16F1459 USB-capable microcontroller with 8k words of program FLASH (6k words free when using the USB bootloader), 128B of user FLASH, 1kB of RAM, 10-bit ADC, and a built-in temperature sensor
- 5 built-in pushbuttons
- 5 visible light LEDs
- 1 piezo beeper output
- optional 8-pin header for PORTC I/O pin expansion (great for servos, a SONAR module, NeoPixels, an LCD, etc.)
- optional IR LED output for remote control transmitter applications (or a high-current transistor-driven output)
- optional IR demodulator for remote control decoding
- optional IR phototransistor or visible-light ambient light sensor for light sensing
- USB 2.0 type-C port for power and programming
- 6-pin ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header for PICkit-4

## UBMP4.1 Software Features

UBMP4.1 uses the [USB uC](https://github.com/johnnydrazzi/USB-uC) bootloader, which makes UBMP4.1 appear as a USB mass storage device. Programs can be developed in C or assembly code using Microchip Technology's MPLAB X IDE or the MPLAB Xpress web-based IDE, or in any programming language or software that creates a Microchip-compatible .hex output file.

Just plug UBMP4.1 into a USB port, wait for it to appear on your computer as drive ***PIC16F1459***, and drag your compiled .hex file onto the drive. UMBP4.1 starts running your program as soon as the .hex file is transferred.
